# Professional Biography

My name is Collin Fox, a fifth-year Dean’s List computer science student at the University of Cincinnati, currently working part-time for my co-op company called International Technegroup, Inc. in Milford, Ohio. Proficient in several programming languages, I gained hands-on experience as a software development co-op, and have enhanced many skills applicable to my desired position.

I am most comfortable programming in Python and Java. I am also fluent in SQL (MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and Oracle). I have created a website for my music production side-hobby in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The past four years I have worked with these languages extensively and have one year of work experience with them. I have no problems getting my thoughts out on paper, e-Mail, or Microsoft Office, which I have used nearly my entire life. 

My most significant strengths are my problem-solving skills, perseverance, communication, and documentation. I work well on a team as well as individually. I have been described as easy-going, adaptive, and an excellent listener. By doing whatever it takes to grasp unfamiliar concepts, I can push through even the toughest of tasks. I am a member of the University of Cincinnati’s Bearcat Coders programming club and am a member of the National Society of Collegiate Scholars (NSCS).

# Co-op Experience

**Spring 2018 - International Technegroup, Inc. (Software Developer)**
During my first co-op term at International Technegroup, I was assigned tasks of lower priority while I was familiarizing myself with the software development process. I greatly improved my skills with Eclipse as I used this application to fix the reports page of DEXcenter, which provide information about previous "sessions" (a DEXcenter part file conversion or comparison). I also strengthened my skills with SQL (MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server) as our DEXcenter reports fetch data from the previous sessions by querying DEXcenter's database. 

My ability to pay attention to detail improved greatly during this term as I learned how changes made to files must be thoroughly tested to prevent errors caused by dependencies in other files. I improved this skill with everything I worked on, particularly when committing changed files and writing Java code. Pushing changes to files is a delicate process as a single misplaced character can result in the software failing to work as intended, if at all. Although unintentional changes can be backed out, I learned to avoid doing this as it clutters the repository with unnecessary pushes. Java is a very syntax-focused programming language; a mistake as simple as forgetting to add a semicolon to the end of a line can render DEXcenter unusable. 

**Fall 2019, Summer 2020 - International Technegroup, Inc. (Software Developer)**
My second co-op term I was essentially seen as a full-time non-intern employee and was assigned tasks of similar difficulty to the rest of the DEXcenter team. Near the beginning of the term I fixed bugs residing in extensively hierarchical Java code and tested multiple DEXcenter functions, providing documentation to my team with the results of my testing. I additionally wrote python scripts, Windows .bat files, and Linux .sh files from scratch to streamline the configuration of our software. I also fixed issues with our database tables (e.g. resolved all problems that arose when creating and populating DEXcenter's database) by modifying SQL code.

This co-op term greatly enhanced my time-prioritization skills as I would frequently be assigned new higher-priority tasks. It was crucial to put my current projects on hold until the more important issues were resolved, such as the problem our Honeywell customers were experiencing with our reports page not displaying. Particularly with these customer-specific issues, my time-prioritization was additionally tested by needing to work as time-efficient as possible, dynamically considering each way to approach a problem during each stage of the problem-solving process, and choosing the direction that provides the desired results with the smallest customer wait-time as possible.

# Requested Project Type
I have several options in mind:

**Option 1** 
-Python compiler that uses the value of %PYTHONHOME% to compile python code in the correct version. It will prompt you for the source .py file and destination .pyc location, which it will store in .txt files for the next use, to speed things up. This will be a combination of batch code and python code. I have yet to find a good python compiler that can preserve the path of where you'd like to compile to (if you try compiling and the output folder isn't the same as where you plan on running python from, it will give you an error in the compiled python scripts as paths are 'embedded' in the .pyc files) as well as be universal for all python versions. 

**Option 2**
-File searching utility that uses a combination of batch commands and Python calls to search for the desired string (whether it be inside a file, or in the filename) in the least amount of time, with higher accuracy than the Windows search box. While on co-op I noticed the search box would often give "no results found" even though the file was infact inside the folder I was searching in. Additionally, it was very slow. For "Find in files" searches I had to use a separate program (Notepad++), so this tool will greatly speed things up, increase search accuracy, and be easier to use since it will all be included in one utility. 

**Option 3**
-Python program that uses macros in FL studio to create beats for you based on many questions the program will ask you. Will have you make a melody in an online melody making utility, whose notes will be exported for use in FL Studio. It will randomize the locations of notes for a certain section, based on if you chose 3/4 or 4/4 time, what section you'd like to randomize, and how many notes you'd like to insert. Will have a GUI to visualize the beat patterns. You can pick what sections to randomize and what sections to keep, until a whole beat is built. Will open FL Studio silently like the CAD systems that are opened at my co-op.

**Option 4**
-Java & Python call tracker to make it easier to know whic company files are being called, when, and where. At my last co-op it was quite difficult to keep track of all the Java calls, Python calls, and Java calls to python. This tool would be very helpful not only for myself but for our entire development team at ITI.
