<p1> Hi I am Prathamesh, a  senior at UC majoring in Computer Science. So far I have had 3 coop experiences, 2 company and 1 research coop.</p1>

<h3>1st Coop: DLZ Corp, Junior Developer (Feb 2017 - May 2017)</h3>
<p2>Technical knowlege gained: Learnt to code in Swift for iOS development, learnt about sending and receiving data from client to server using json, applied python skills to automate important tasks for the company.</p2>

<h3>2nd Coop: UC CEAS, Research Developer (Aug 2018 - Dec 2018)</h3>
<p3>Technical knowlege gained: Learnt about how research projects work and found a free open source environment to build the main driving simulation on, learnt to use Unreal engine to build the final simulation with the help of their blueprint system and sometimes C++ code.</p3>

<h3>3rd Coop: Electronauts LLC, Software Developer (May 2019 - Aug 2019)</h3>
<p4>Technical knowlege gained: Learnt and coded in C# the first time ever using visual studio, built an application for the company to take their entire quality control department digital and made a proper system to record everything on servers using MySQL.</p4>

<h3>Part Time: UC CEAS. Teaching Assistant (Aug 2016 - Dec 2016)</h3>
<p5>Was a TA for a semester for Models 1.</p5>

<h3>What I am looking for?</h3>
<p6>I want to do something purely software based or at least try to minimize as much hardware inclusion as possible. Something I was looking at was creating an environment for a coder to use multiple languages in the same project or even file if possible.</p6>
