<h2>Project Background Description</h2>
Currently there is not a way to determine the exact amount of rainfall on campus at the University of Cincinnati. 

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
The data analyzed by this project can be used to estimate the stress and erosion that is put on the structures here, which can be used to determine when maintenence should be performed and prevent potentially deadly accidents from occurring in the event of a failure.

<h2>Inadquacy of Current Solutions to Problem</h2>
The rainfall can currently be estimated for the entire region of Cincinnati, but this is likely to differ from the amount of rainfall that the University of Cincinnati experiences. 

<h2>Background Knowledge</h2>
Smit - C#, SQL, Python, Java, Arduino Boards and other data analysis sensors
Prathamesh - C#, Java, Python
Collin - Java, Python, HTML & CSS (Web Development), SQL, Mobile Application Development
Jessica - C#, SQL, HTML & CSS (Web Development), Arduino Boards

<h2>Goals and Expectations</h2>
Our primary goal is to capture the rainfall that is experienced by UC and provide notifications to users of the mobile application in the event of either any rainfall at all to only severe rain, depending on the user's settings. We expect the Arduino board, wifi modules, and ultrasonic sensors to allow us to capture the data, which will then be analyzed by Java, Python, or C#, and be stored in an SQL database and displayed either in a web browser or mobile application.
