<h2>Project Background Description</h2>
Currently there is not a way to determine the exact amount of rainfall on campus at the University of Cincinnati. 

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
The data analyzed by this project can be used to estimate the stress and erosion that is put on the structures here, which can be used to determine when maintenence should be performed and prevent potentially deadly accidents from occurring in the event of a failure.

<h2>Inadquacy of Current Solutions to Problem</h2>
The rainfall can currently be estimated for the entire region of Cincinnati, but this is likely to differ
