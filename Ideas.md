# Ideas for Project

**Collin, idea #1**
-Python compiler that can compile python code in any python version, all online. The backend code could be .py, with html/css as the frontend. I have yet to find a good python compiler that can preserve the path of where you'd like to compile to (if you try compiling and the output folder isn't the same as where you plan on running python from, it will give you an error in the compiled python scripts as paths are 'embedded' in the .pyc files) I made a python compiler while on co-op that we could use as a base to work off of.

**Collin, idea #2**
-File searching utility that uses a combination of batch commands and Python calls to search for the desired string (whether it be inside a file, or in the filename) in the least amount of time, with higher accuracy than the Windows search box. While on co-op I noticed the search box would often give "no results found" even though the file was infact inside the folder I was searching in. Additionally, it was very slow. For "Find in files" searches I had to use a separate program (Notepad++), so this tool will greatly speed things up, increase search accuracy, and be easier to use since it will all be included in one utility.
