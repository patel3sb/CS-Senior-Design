[How to Use our Website](https://github.com/prat97/CS-Senior-Design/blob/master/USER%20DOCS/How%20To%20Use%20Our%20Website)

Note: Users of our project are those wishing to access rainfall information using our website. Users will not need to know how to set up any of the wiring, materials needed, how to turn the raspberry pi, how to connect to the DB, etc. They will only need to know how to use the website, hence why only one user doc has been created.
