<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measuring, storing, analyzing, and displaying the amount of rainfall experienced by the University of Cincinnati, our group will utilize many different types of technology. The rainfall data we collect has the potential to prevent fatal disasters by allowing construction and architecture crews to estimate the amount of time various structures will be safe to use by the public. The amount of erosion experienced by various structures can be estimated by having the user denote the type of material (and optionally the size and force exerted on it, to make these estimations more accurate.) This data provided by the user, combined with our rainfall data and calculations, will provide these time estimations. The amount of rainfall experienced by the larger Cincinnati area differs from the amount of rainfall experienced by the University of Cincinnati. We will reduce the scope to the UC campus area to provide more accurate and less general data.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Computer Science curriculum at the University of Cincinnati has provided both technical and non-technical skills that will be utilized in this project. Engineering Foundations improved my ability to capture data through the exposure to ultrasonic sensors, force meters, and current/voltage meters. Made easier from the knowledge gained from this course, our group will be using ultrasonic sensors to determine the amount of rain that has fallen. Engineering Models I and II taught both technical and non-technical practices to display data in an adequately verbose manner, particularly through the use of MATLAB and data plotting functions. I learned how to keep the user in mind when analyzing and displaying data, by considering if the average person would be able to understand the data when viewing it. This knowledge also assisted me in my Intelligent Data Analysis course where I was able to apply similar analyzation and plotting strategies in Python, a programming language our group will be using to analyze the rainfall data we collect.</p>






â€¢ Two paragraphs on how your collective college experiences will guide developing this project.

One paragraph should focus on how the college curriculum and the second paragraph on your co-op experiences. Discuss the role of specific CS courses (include course numbers and titles), and your specific co-op employers (include company names and job titles). In these paragraphs you should discuss technical and non-technical skills, how you acquired them, and how you expect to apply them.
