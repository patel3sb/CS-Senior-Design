<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Measuring, storing, analyzing, and displaying the amount of rainfall experienced by the University of Cincinnati, our group will utilize many different types of technology. The rainfall data we collect has the potential to prevent fatal disasters by allowing construction and architecture crews to estimate the amount of time various structures will be safe to use by the public. The amount of rainfall experienced by the larger Cincinnati area differs from the amount of rainfall experienced by the University of Cincinnati. Our  is no way to measure the exact amount of rainfall experienced by UC campus</p>
