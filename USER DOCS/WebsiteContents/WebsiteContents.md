# Website Contents

Our project consists of five pages:
  * Rainfall https://github.com/prat97/CS-Senior-Design/blob/master/USER%20DOCS/Pictures/RainfallPage.png
  * Structures https://github.com/prat97/CS-Senior-Design/blob/master/USER%20DOCS/Pictures/StructuresPage.png
  * Tools https://github.com/prat97/CS-Senior-Design/blob/master/USER%20DOCS/Pictures/ToolsPage.png
  * About https://github.com/prat97/CS-Senior-Design/blob/master/USER%20DOCS/Pictures/AboutPage.png
  * Contact https://github.com/prat97/CS-Senior-Design/blob/master/USER%20DOCS/Pictures/ContactPage.png

Every page in our website contains the following:
 * Top: Navigation panel with 5 options (Rainfall, Structures, Tools, About, Contact)
 * Middle: main page content (varies by page, explained below)
 * Bottom: footer containing text "This website was created for CS5002 Senior Design Project"

<h2>1. "Rainfall" Page</h2>

![RainfallPage](https://github.com/prat97/CS-Senior-Design/blob/master/USER%20DOCS/Pictures/RainfallPage.png)

Rainfall-page-specific contents:
 * Page numbers selector - By clicking either the numbered pages or the "Next" and "Previous" buttons, one can navigate between each page of data (20 rows per page)
 * Data from 'sensorreadings' DB table - consists of dates, times, and rainfall values in inches. These values are inserted each night at 11:59 PM. To account for the small amount of tolerance/error, values less than .05 will be discarded/set to 0.00. To prevent the need to empty the rainfall-collecting beaker each night, the following equation is used: Rainfall=CurrentReading-PreviousNight
 * Graph of rainfall levels by date - automatically generated by python script "MakeRainfallPlot.py". Rainfall data on the current page are set as variables in Structures.php, then passed as arguments in a call to MakeRainfallPlot.py, all occuring just before the page finishes loading.

<h2>2. "Structures" Page</h2>

![StructuresPage](https://github.com/prat97/CS-Senior-Design/blob/master/USER%20DOCS/Pictures/StructuresPage.png)

Structures-page-specific contents:
 * Building selector drop down menu - "post" requests use whatever building name is selected in the dropdown menu upon clicking "Calculate" - python script "EstimateErosion.py" is then used to determine whether a building is in good standing, fair, or poor, in addition to displaying the estimated amount of erosion experienced by that structure (unless determined to be negligible, i.e. when the building material's density is greater than 150 lbs/ft^3 (approximate density of concrete))
 * Data from 'buildings' DB table - consists of various UC building information, as seen in image above
 * Upon clicking "Calculate": building status and estimated erosion are displayed.

<h2>3. "Tools" Page</h2>

![ToolsPage](https://github.com/prat97/CS-Senior-Design/blob/master/USER%20DOCS/Pictures/ToolsPage.png)

Tools-page-specific contents:
 * Form entry boxes (length, width, height, individual unit types, unit type to convert to, material type)
 * Data from 'materials' DB table - consists of various material types and their average costs, columns and data seen in image above
 * Depending on the user-selected options, clicking "Calculate" reveals the following data: Area or Volume, the user-chosen material type, the building age in years, and a python-calculated cost estimation (via EstimateCosts.py).
